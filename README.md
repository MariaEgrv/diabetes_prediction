# diabetes_prediction

In this notebook i create a model that will predict whether a person does or does not have diabetes. I am using a modified diabetes.csv dataset, the original can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mathchi/diabetes-data-set).

The target column in the dataset is "Outcome".
